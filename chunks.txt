Text: title: a shocking chinese ai advancement called deepseek is sending us stocks plunging cnn us stocks dropped sharply monday and chipmaker nvidia lost nearly 600 billion in market value after a surprise advancement from a chinese artificial intelligence company, deepseek , threatened the aura of invincibility surrounding americas technology industry. deepseek , a one-year-old startup, revealed a stunning capability last week: it presented a chatgpt-like ai model called r1, which has all the familiar abilities, operating at a fraction of the cost of openais, googles or metas popular ai models. the company said it had spent just 5.6 million on computing power for its base model, compared with the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars us companies spend on their ai technologies. that sent shockwaves through markets, in particular the tech sector, on monday. the tech-heavy nasdaq plunged by 3.1 and the broader sp 500 fell 1.5. the dow, boosted by health care and consumer companies that could be hurt by ai, was up 289 points, or about 0.7 higher. stock market losses were far deeper at the beginning of the day. meta last week said it would spend upward of 65 billion this year on ai development. sam altman, ceo of openai, last year said the ai industry would need trillions of dollars in investment to support the development of in-demand chips needed to power the electricity-hungry data centers that run the sectors complex models. marc andreessen, a supporter of president donald trump and one of the worlds leading tech investors, called deepseek one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs ive ever seen, in a post on x . the stunning achievement from a relatively unknown ai startup becomes even more shocking when considering that the united states for years has worked to restrict the supply of

Text: leading tech investors, called deepseek one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs ive ever seen, in a post on x . the stunning achievement from a relatively unknown ai startup becomes even more shocking when considering that the united states for years has worked to restrict the supply of high-power ai chips to china , citing national security concerns. that means deepseek was able to achieve its low-cost model on under-powered ai chips. tech stocks tumble us tech stocks got hammered monday. nvidia nvda , the leading supplier of ai chips, fell nearly 17 and lost 588.8 billion in market value by far the most market value a stock has ever lost in a single day, more than doubling the previous record of 240 billion set by meta nearly three years ago. for perspective, nvidia lost more in market value monday than all but 13 companies are worth period. nvidia began the day as the most valuable publicly traded stock on the market over 3.4 trillion after its shares more than doubled in each of the past two years. it ended the day in third place behind apple and microsoft. meta meta and alphabet googl , googles parent company, were also down sharply. nvidia competitors marvell, broadcom, micron and tsmc all fell sharply, too. oracle orcl , vertiv, constellation, nuscale and other energy and data center companies tumbled. that dragged down the broader stock market, because tech stocks make up a significant chunk of the market tech constitutes about 45 of the sp 500, according to keith lerner, analyst at truist. the bottom line is the us outperformance has been driven by tech and the lead that us companies have in ai, lerner said. the deepseek model rollout is leading investors to question the lead that us companies have

Text: gpt generative pre-trained transformer and deepseek represent two distinct approaches and philosophies in the field of artificial intelligence, each with its own strengths, focus areas, and applications. gpt, developed by openai, is a family of large language models designed primarily for natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, and conversation. it operates on a foundation of deep learning and transformer architecture, which enables it to process and generate human-like text by predicting the next word in a sequence based on vast amounts of training data. gpt models, such as gpt-3 and gpt-4, have gained widespread recognition for their ability to produce coherent and contextually relevant text, making them valuable tools for content creation, customer support, and educational applications. however, gpts capabilities are largely confined to narrow ai, meaning it excels in specific tasks but lacks the generalized intelligence required to reason, learn, and adapt across diverse domains. in contrast, deepseek, founded in 2023, is focused on achieving artificial general intelligence agi, a form of intelligence that mirrors human cognitive abilities and can perform a wide range of tasks with minimal supervision. while gpt models are trained on massive datasets to optimize for specific language-related tasks, deepseeks approach involves developing advanced neural network architectures and reinforcement learning techniques that enable its systems to handle unstructured data, reason through complex problems, and adapt to new challenges. deepseeks innovations extend beyond language processing to areas like healthcare, education, climate modeling, and autonomous systems, where its ai technologies are used to analyze medical data, create adaptive learning platforms, optimize supply chains, and assist in scientific research. another key difference lies in their ethical frameworks and development philosophies. openai has emphasized the importance of responsible ai development, implementing safeguards to prevent misuse and promoting transparency in its research. similarly, deepseek has established

Text: when comparing the model parameters of gpt generative pre-trained transformer and deepseek, several key differences and similarities emerge, reflecting their distinct goals, architectures, and applications. gpt, developed by openai, is a family of large language models that rely heavily on transformer architecture, which uses self-attention mechanisms to process and generate text. the most advanced versions, such as gpt-3 and gpt-4, are known for their massive scale, with gpt-3 boasting 175 billion parameters and gpt-4 rumored to have an even larger parameter count, potentially exceeding 1 trillion. these parameters represent the weights and connections within the neural network, enabling the model to capture intricate patterns in language data and generate coherent, contextually relevant text. gpt models are trained on vast datasets comprising text from books, articles, websites, and other sources, allowing them to perform tasks like text completion, translation, summarization, and conversational ai with remarkable proficiency. however, despite their scale, gpt models are fundamentally narrow ai systems, meaning they excel in specific language-related tasks but lack the generalized intelligence required to reason, learn, and adapt across diverse domains. in contrast, deepseek, founded in 2023 with the goal of achieving artificial general intelligence agi, takes a different approach to model parameters and architecture. while specific details about deepseeks model sizes are not publicly disclosed, the companys focus on agi suggests a more complex and versatile design compared to gpt. deepseeks models likely incorporate advanced neural network architectures that go beyond traditional transformers, integrating techniques such as reinforcement learning, meta-learning, and multimodal learning to enable reasoning, adaptability, and problem-solving across a wide range of tasks. unlike gpt, which is primarily optimized for language processing, deepseeks models are designed to handle unstructured data from multiple modalities, including text, images, audio, and sensor inputs, making them suitable for applications in healthcare, robotics, climate modeling, and
